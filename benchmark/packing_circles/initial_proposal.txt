Packing circles inside a unit square to maximize sum of radii
Given a positive integer  n , the problem is to pack  n  disjoint circles inside a unit square so as to maximize the sum of their radii. 

For  n=26 , the SOTA was  2.634.
For  n=32 , the SOTA was  2.936.

Your goal is to create an algorithm to maximize sum of radii and reduce blank space.
