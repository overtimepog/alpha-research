This program presents a novel approach to finding an improved upper bound for the C3-norm of a function, a quantity relevant to signal processing and harmonic analysis. The problem is framed as an optimization task, and a genetic algorithm is employed to solve it. The core of the algorithm involves evolving a sequence of function heights (represented as a NumPy array) that define a piecewise-constant function. The fitness of each function sequence is determined by its C3-norm value, with the goal of maximizing this value. The genetic algorithm utilizes standard evolutionary operators: tournament selection to choose parents, single-point crossover to exchange genetic information, and Gaussian mutation to introduce random variations. The function's C3-norm is calculated by finding the maximum value of the function's self-convolution, normalized by the square of its L1-norm. This search process aims to discover a specific function configuration that yields a higher C3-norm than previously known examples, thereby establishing a new upper bound for the class of functions under consideration.
