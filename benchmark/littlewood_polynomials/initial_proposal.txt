Littlewood polynomials: minimize sup-norm on the unit circle

Problem definition. Choose coefficients c_k ∈ {±1} for P(z)=∑_{k=0}^{n−1} c_k z^k, |z|=1, to minimize the supremum norm ‖P‖_∞=max_{|z|=1}|P(z)|.

Constraints. Coefficients are ±1. Metric is supnorm estimated by FFT sampling on an equally spaced grid; denser grid → tighter upper bound.

Optimization goal. Minimize supnorm. The evaluator returns a single scalar: supnorm if valid, else −1.0.

Best-known results (human). The optimal value is Θ(√n). Upper bounds: Rudin–Shapiro and variants achieve ‖P‖_∞ ≤ C√n (C≈2 in practice). Lower bounds: ‖P‖_∞ ≥ c√n for an absolute c>0. Practical searches aim to reduce the constant for fixed n.

Algorithm goal. Construct ±1 sequences with smaller supnorm. This baseline uses Rudin–Shapiro; stronger methods include local flips, simulated annealing, coordinate descent on ±1 (with careful acceptance), and spectral heuristics guided by FFT magnitudes.
