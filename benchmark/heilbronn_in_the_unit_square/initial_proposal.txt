Heilbronn in the unit square: verify asymptotic upper bound (n = 30)

Problem redefinition. We treat Heilbronn’s problem at n = 30 as an upper-bound verification task. Given n points in [0,1]^2, define Δ(n) as the minimum triangle area over all triples. Recent results give an asymptotic upper bound
  Δ(n) = O(n^{-8/7 - 1/2000}).

Metric (larger is better). For a candidate configuration P with min_area = Δ_P, we compute
  scaled_min_area = n^{8/7 + 1/2000} * Δ_P,
  score = 1 / scaled_min_area.
A larger score indicates a smaller scaled_min_area, i.e., better agreement with (or improvement toward) the asymptotic upper bound.

Constraints. Points must lie in [0,1]^2.

Evaluator. The evaluator computes Δ_P, then returns a dict including:
  {"score", "scaled_min_area", "min_area", "n"},
with score as the main metric (larger is better).

Baseline. We use a hexagonal-lattice-inspired construction with light jitter to generate n = 30 points.

Goal. Construct point sets that minimize scaled_min_area (equivalently, maximize score), thereby pushing toward the asymptotic upper bound regime for n = 30.
