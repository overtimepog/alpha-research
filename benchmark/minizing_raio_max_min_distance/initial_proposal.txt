This program describes a Python algorithm that uses an enhanced simulated annealing approach to find an optimal arrangement of n points in a d-dimensional space. The primary goal is to minimize the ratio of the maximum to minimum pairwise Euclidean distances among the points, a classic problem in geometric optimization.
The implementation refines the standard simulated annealing framework with several key improvements. It uses an adaptive cooling schedule that dynamically adjusts the temperature based on the algorithm's recent acceptance rate, allowing for more efficient convergence. To prevent the points from clumping together and to help escape local minima, the algorithm incorporates a dynamic repulsion mechanism that pushes points away from their nearest neighbors. A periodic smoothing step further enhances point uniformity by repositioning points based on a distance-weighted average of their neighbors. The use of a cKDTree accelerates the nearest-neighbor searches required for these techniques. The algorithm also includes a final local refinement stage to fine-tune the best-found solution, and its hyperparameters are tuned to adapt to the dimensionality of the problem.
