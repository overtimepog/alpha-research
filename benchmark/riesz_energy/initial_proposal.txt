Riesz s-energy on [0,1]: minimize pairwise potential

Problem definition. Choose x_1,…,x_n ∈ [0,1] to minimize the Riesz s-energy
E_s = ∑_{i<j} |x_i−x_j|^{−s}, with s>0. We also report the minimum spacing.

Constraints. Points lie in [0,1]. Metric is energy (smaller is better); auxiliary: min_spacing.

Optimization goal. Minimize energy. The evaluator returns a single scalar (energy) or −1.0 on invalid.

Best-known results (human). On a line segment, for any decreasing convex distance-only potential (including d^{−s}, s>0), equally spaced points including endpoints minimize the energy: x_i = i/(n−1), i=0,…,n−1.

Algorithm goal. Construct point sets with smaller energy. This baseline outputs equally spaced points; for variants (e.g., noisy starts), use projected gradient/coordinate descent, global heuristics, or convexity-guided relaxation to recover the optimal grid.
